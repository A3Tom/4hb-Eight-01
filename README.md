# Eight #

This project is part of the 4 hour builds series

Concept Iteration 01

## Background : ##

I have an alarm set every day of the year for 8pm to make sure I am aware of what I am doing at 8pm; I once heard that you can tell a lot about a person by what they are doing at 8pm and that's stuck with me.

## Concept : ##

A system to log what I'm doing at 8pm each day along with categorization and report tools.
